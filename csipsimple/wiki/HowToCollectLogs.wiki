= Introduction =

CSipSimple is still under heavy development. If you notice a force close or an error while running the app. 
The first good reflex is to search on the Issue section if you are alone with the problem.
Then if you found nothing corresponding to your issue, you can open a new one. One thing that can do the fix of your issue quicker is to provides logs to allow developers to understand what has happened. 

= How to turn on logging on CSipSimple =

 # Press the menu button on the main CSipSimple view (the dialer), 
 # Choose Help and press "Record logs to send it to dev team and report a bug".
 # Go back using the back button.

= Reproduce your bug now =

You can now reproduce your bug (if possible) logs are recorded.

= How to get back the logs and what to do with the logs =

 # Press the menu button on the main CSipSimple view 
 # Choose Help and press "Stop recording logs (OPTIONALY send it)".
 # After a little while it asks for an app to use to send the logs (usually gmail or email). If there is no app to send email this method will not work.
 # In the body describe your problem or the issue of the issue list associated if you opened one.
